					<p>I am currently a sophomore at Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School. This is my third year of VEX and my 7th year of robotics as a whole. I am the captain and main CAD designer for this team. Robotics piqued my interest from a young age for one major reason; it allowed me to practice practical problem-solving in a structured environment. Aside from robotics, I am deeply passionate about genetic research, golf, Model UN and mentoring younger roboticists. Cranbrook’s robotics program is wonderful and it is truly an honor to be able compete as a part of this distinguished organization.</p>

					<p>I am fourteen and going into my freshman year of high school at Cranbrook. This will be my 5th year doing vex iq/vex robotics (4th year competing), and I have been to the world championship all three years of middle school. I am the chief mechanic of this team. Besides my love of robotics I also enjoy history, playing strategic board games, and building model vehicles. I’m very interested in robotics because I enjoy learning about the mechanics behind how robots are made and what ways robots can shape the ways of the future. I’m excited and proud to be able to participate in such an amazing robotics program.</p>

					<p>I am 14 years old and am a sophomore at Cranbrook Kingswood. In my free time, I like making small Java projects and playing guitar. Robotics is important to be because it allows me to exercise my programming knowledge. I am the Chief Programmer of this team. Programming captivates my interest because it allows me to remotely control robots in a fashion that I have never been able to before. I look forward to a great year!</p>

					<p>I am 13 years old, and am a freshman at Cranbrook Kingswood. This is my 4th year in Cranbrook’s robotics. I am the chief strategist and assistant programmer for this team. I’ve always been interested in robotics because of its competitive nature. Apart from robotics, I enjoy playing the Bassoon, Piano, Alto Saxophone, Baseball, and Basketball. I’m proud to be on Team 39X and I look forward to a great year!</p>

					<p>I am 13 years old. I am a freshman at Cranbrook Kingswood and have been going here since 6th grade. This is my fourth year participating in vex/ vex iq. I have been to worlds three times. I am the Team Manager and Coach to this team. Besides robotics, I like to read, play the piano, and play video games. I decided to participate in robotics because I like to build things. I am excited to be on 39X and hope we do well.</p>
